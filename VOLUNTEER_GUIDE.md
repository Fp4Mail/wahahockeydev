## Quick Tips

### Writing Tips
- âœ… **Keep titles short** - "U10 Tournament Results" not "Results from the Amazing U10 Tournament That Happened Last Weekend"
- âœ… **Use simple language** - Write like you're talking to a friend
- âœ… **Include details** - When, where, who, what happened

### Photo Tips
- âœ… **Smaller is better** - Large photos slow down the website
- âœ… **Action shots work great** - Kids playing, celebrating, learning
- âœ… **Get permission** - Make sure parents are okay with photos being posted

### Video Tips
- âœ… **Upload to YouTube first** - Then link to it from the website
- âœ… **Add good titles** - "WAHA U12 Championship Goal" is better than "Video 1"
- âœ… **Keep them short** - 2-3 minutes is perfect for highlights
